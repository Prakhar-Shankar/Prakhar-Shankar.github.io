## The Brain Rot

The term simply means - ones messed up attention spam. All the reels, shorts, snaps, stories and every other form of short content is somehow evolving our brain in negative way.
You can not remain bored now, because there is never a time where you don't have to do anything. When you are free and at leisure you picks up you little smart phone and the game begins, now you have hell lot
of work to do, now you are the busiest man on the planet cause you have to post something put up a story maybe, check the reel or memes you friends have sent and what not.

I was feeling this thing these days. I was not able to concentrate on one thing after writing a basic script on python I used to feel that I have done something big and I deserve a break. Hence I used
to pick up my phone even for 15 mintues but that at the end of the day sums up to hours and I also I asked myself why I am getting so sympathetic towards me. Why I needed the break.

Hence for the solution I started meditating surely got the results but still that itch to check the phone stayed. Hence I deleted all the social media application Day1 well spent lets see how will I do in future.

Thanks
