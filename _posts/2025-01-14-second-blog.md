## Project PySon

## Description
Hey everyone, I am writing this blog to keep a journal of a project that I have am working on. Actually it is in the idea phase currently. I will try my best to build this project.

## Idea
So, actually I was working on an issue, where we have to flag the missing and unused keys of JSON file in Python files.
- Unused keys -> These are those keys which are present in the json file but are not in use inside the python files.
- Missing keys -> These are those keys which are used in the python files but are not present in the json file.

These things are very useful for i18n, many tools are already available but they are efficient in other languages. A tool called `vue-i18n-extract` is used to find these keys for .vue files. Some tools are available for Ruby and other languages, but, it was difficult to find such tools for Python.
Hence I thought of building such tool.

Therefore, my upcoming blogs will be mostly about the development I made in the project or my new contributions.
Thanks
