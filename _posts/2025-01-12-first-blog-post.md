## First Blog

## Who Am I?
Hi I am Prakhar, currently I am in my 4th year. I am a computer science undergrad. I have created this blog to share any technical thing I like doing. It can be a movie, book, podcast, porject, github repo or an internship. I just want to journal what I am currently doing. There is literally no motive behind writing and creating these blogs.

I want to share information and my emotions about the people who inspire me to code and program.
I will write detailed blog about the project I am working on and I will also share the source of inspiration for choosing that project.
Also I will love to share about the repo/project that I am currently trying to contribute to.

That's more than enough for my first blog.
Bye!<3
